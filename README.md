# project-site guidelines
## This is TCMG 412 Group 7's project website! 
If you want to make changes or add content units to the website, it is **recommended** to make pull requests, per the assignment: **"At a minimum, I expect at least one pull request per content unit in your site."**
Also, feel free to make edits and any comments to content units that are created. It's encouraged since edits should be made by at least two members from our team.
For further discussion, refer to our Slack. Gig 'em!
