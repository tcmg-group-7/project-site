# project-site guidelines

If you want to make changes or add content units to the website, it is **recommended** to make pull requests, per the assignment: **"At a minimum, I expect at least one pull request per content unit in your site."**

## Be sure to merge your pull requests to the *gh-pages* branch, that is where the changes and website take place.

Also, feel free to make edits and any comments to content units that are created. It's encouraged since edits should be made by at least two members from our team.
For further discussion, refer to our Slack. Gig 'em!
